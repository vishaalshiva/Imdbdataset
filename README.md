# Imdb Data Set

IMDB Data Prep file has the code related to Exploratory Data Analysis, understanding the variables and joining the different tables to form a final Dataframe which would further be used in the subsequent files for the Data Model

Univariate Bivariate & Modelling. 
Consists of further Data Wrangling, Doing Bivariate Analysis and getting the data in a form that would be ready to put in the model. 

Modelling
Used Random Forest Model and got a training accuracy of 94%

Given more time to do the analysis I would work on bringing the training accuracy down because its clearly over-fitting the data.

My next steps would be to then take insights from the model and understand the weights of each coefficients. Once you have the weights you can then segment high rated movings with its corresponding attributes which would give you a deeper insight and intuition of the variables. This would help us better predict given a new data point
