# Imdb Data Set

1) IMDB Data Prep file 

has the code related to Exploratory Data Analysis, understanding the variables and joining the different tables to form a final Dataframe which would further be used in the subsequent analysis for the Data Model

2) Univariate Bivariate & Modelling. 

  Consists of further Data Wrangling, doing Bivariate Analysis and getting the data in a form that would be ready for model ingestions.

Modelling

  Used Random Forest Model and got a training R-squared accuracy of 94% and a test R-squared accuracy of 61% 

  Given more time to do the analysis I would work on bringing the diffference of the training and test accuracy down because its clearly over-fitting the data.

  My next steps then would be to take insights from the model and understand the weights of each coefficients. Once you have the weights you can then segment high    rated movings with its corresponding attributes which would give you a deeper insight and intuition of the variables/models. This would help us better predict given a new data point.
